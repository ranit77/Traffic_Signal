## Traffic Light Simulation (HTML/CSS)
### Project Overview

This project is a clean, front-end implementation of a traffic light UI component created using pure HTML and CSS. It demonstrates my ability to build structured layouts, apply custom styling, and work with positioning, alignment, and shapes without relying on external libraries.

### The interface includes:

A vertically aligned traffic signal panel with red, yellow, and green indicators.

A support stand built using CSS box-model properties.

A responsive road bar spanning the viewport width.

A visually centered and polished layout suitable for UI/UX demonstrations.

### Purpose of the Project

The objective of this project was to strengthen my understanding of:

CSS layout techniques

Absolute and relative positioning

Responsive design with viewport units

Visual UI construction using pure front-end technologies

Box-model behavior and shape creation (circles, ovals, rounded rectangles)

This project also serves as a portfolio piece to demonstrate front-end fundamentals and attention to detail.

### Technologies Used

HTML5

CSS3

No JavaScript or external frameworks were used.

### Key Features

Traffic light made only with HTML/CSS

Pixel-perfect alignment of signal lights inside the panel

Styled road section with centered label

Demonstrates understanding of CSS rendering flow and stacking context
